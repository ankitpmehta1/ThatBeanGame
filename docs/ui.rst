How to play
===========
Starting a game
---------------
1. If you are the first person in your group, pick a user name and click "Create Game". Otherwise ask the first person for the game ID in the upper left corner of their screen and enter in the Game ID box and click "Join Game" 
2. Once everyone that you want to play with has joined the game, the first player needs to click "Start Game". 
3. Once the game has started, you follow the standard Bohnanza rules, which I won't duplicate here.

Explanation of UI
-----------------
I tried to make this as intuitive as possible, but I realize it's probably not intuitive at all. So here's what everything is/does:

* Top left corner is your game ID followed by the state of the game (running, completed, etc).
* Next to this is an "Exit" button which allows you to completed detach yourself from the game. Game login is done by cookies, so if you need to refresh you are still logged in. This button destroys that cookie.
* In the top middle is whose turn it is. 
* Top right is your name and how many points you have.
* Boxes on the left and right (if > 4 total players) represent each player.
    - Top of the box is player name
    - Three small rectangles represent fields. 
        - Number represents how many card they have in that field
        - Title text represent what card that field is made of
    - Gold circle represents number of coins they have
    - Grey rectangle represents number of cards in their hand
    - If their is an H to the right of the number of cards in their hand, that means they are the host (first one in the game)
    - Opposing arrows is a button you click to start trading. See trading below
* Top left darkened area is the deck and discard pile.
    - Deck is on the left and shows number of cards left and playthough
    - Discard is on right and shows number of cards in discard pile
* Top right darkened area is the market. This will hold the two cards that you flip over from the deck. 
* Middle left darkened area is your fields. 
* Middle right darkened area is the trade center. See trading below.
* Bottom darkened area is your hand. Left side being the "top" card in your hand, right being the "back".

Highlighted cards represent cards you can click in that moment. There are a few bug in this currently, such as the entire hand highlighting when you can only click the first card.
